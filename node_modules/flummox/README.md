## Versions

### Stable (3.x)

Current stable Flummox's version with latest [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) support is **3.6.x**. If you're happy enough with what you have right now then **you can safely stay with this version**. It will be maintained but we don't think that new features will be added.

### Non-stable (4.x)

**Eventually 4.x should be the last major release but it never happened**. If you want the latest features then use [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux) instead. It's really great.

_We know that churn can be frustrating but we feel it would be irresponsible for us to continue recommending Flummox when Redux exists which is a significant improvement over classical Flux._

**Check out [redux-actions](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-actions) and [redux-promise](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-promise), which implement much of the convenience of Flummox as Redux extensions.**
